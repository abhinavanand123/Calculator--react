 #
This is a calculator app built in React and based on the native iOS calculator. The main purpose of building this project was to see the UI of iOS calculator, without choosing    any other format of UI. 

# Improvements

* Text resize as the the number of characters on the screen increases
* Include BODMAS implementation
* A class implementation for the App component may be better so variables in the state object can be merged instead of replaced. This would eliminate the need for returning full    objects each time in the calculate object. This seems to be a limitation for the useState hook
